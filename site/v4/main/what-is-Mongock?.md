# What is Mongock

**Mongock** is a java MongoDB tool for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes across all your environments based on a coding approach.

## Why Mongock

There are several good reasons to use Mongock in your project. Here we give you some of them:

* Solid solution which really works.
* **Works well with sharded collections**: Unlike other similar projects using javascript, which requires `db.eval()`. [Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.eval/#sharded-data)
* Works with [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
* Distributed solution with solid locking mechanism.
* Great support and very responsive.
* Solid open source tool.
* Well maintained and regularly updated.
* Well documented.
* Used by several tech companies in different industries.
* Used by well known frameworks such as [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech).
* Can be used together with most, if not all, frameworks.
* Provides great integration for [Spring](https://spring.io/), allowing you to inject any custom dependency you want to your changeLog method and still been synchronised
* We walk with you to production. Get more information about our support model at [support@mongock.io​](mailto:support@mongock.io​)
