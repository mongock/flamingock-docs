## Introduction 

We already discussed the [Flamingock process](/v1/technical-overview#mongock-process) and the [migration component](/v1/migration) in previous sections where the transactions are already mentioned. 

As its name suggests, a changeUnit represents the unit of a migration. By default each changeUnit is wrapped in a independent transaction. This can be change by configuration, but it's not recommended.

<div class="tip">
<p>In this section we mention <b>native transactions</b>. By this we mean the transaction mechanism provided by the database.</p>
<p>Flamingock always try to provide a transactional environment as much as possible. When native transactions are not possible, it tries to rollback the changes manually with the <a href="/v1/migration#changeunit-methods">@RollbackExecution</a> method.</p>
</div>

## Configuration

<p class="warningAlt">As of Flamingock release 5.5, <b>mongock.transactionEnabled</b> property is deprecated in favour of new <b>mongock.transactional</b> property. Note that is not compatible to use both of them. In a future release <b>mongock.transactionEnabled</b> will be removed.</p>

There are two points where the transactions are configured to be enforced or disabled, the property `mongock.transactional`(setTransactional method in the builder) and the **driver**.

In every driver's page, you will find enough information about how to enable the native transactions.


As explained in the [runner properties table](/v1/runner#Configuration), the Flamingock native transactionability follows the next logic:

<div class="success">
<p >When <b>mongock.transactional</b> is true, it enforces native transactions, throwing an exception is the driver is not capable of it.</p>
<p >When <b>mongock.transactional</b> is false, it disables the transactions and ignores the transactionability of the driver.</p>
<p >When <b>mongock.transactional</b> is null, it totally delegates on the driver the transactionability of the migration.</p>
</div>
 

## How it works

The easiest way to understand how Flamingock handles the transactions is by looking at [this section](/v1/technical-overview#process-steps).


## Best practices

- Always set explicitly the `mongock.transactional` property to true/false.
- DDL operations placed in the @BeforeExecution method of the changeUnit.
